# Movie-Recommendation-System which uses Content Based Reccomendation
This Movie Recommendation System was an exploration into the recommendation system scene. I decided to embarkn on this project to get a bettert idea of how some of my most used technologies like Pinterest, Spotify and Netflix cconstantly suggest really good and relational content. I took a stab at this content based movie recignition system which mainly uses neural networks for recommendation.

The process involved the breakdown of music genres, creation od user product and product feature dataframes. The creation of these helped me get a better understanding on how to analyze key features useful in building a model and manipulate data when needed.

The dataset is of about 9000 movies, ratings, genres and related information and was obtained from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

To run the project you will need to install the libraries of SciKit Learn and Tensorflow
